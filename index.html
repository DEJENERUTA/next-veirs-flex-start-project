              <span class="bold">Laura Veirs</span> grew up in Colorado Springs,
              Colorado, where she often spent summers camping with her family,
              which gave her much of her songwriting inspiration. She now lives
              in Portland, Oregon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Veirs has said that she didn't seriously listen to music until she
              was in her 20s; instead, she just heard what was in her
              environment. She listened to folk, country, classical and pop
              music around the house and on the radio during her youth.
            </p>
          </div>

              Attending Carleton College in rural Minnesota, Veirs latched onto
              feminist punk rock from the Pacific Northwest, eventually starting
              an all-female punk band called "Rair Kx!". Laura studied geology
              and Mandarin Chinese. After college, she embraced older country
              and folk music. Her first foray into songwriting started with a
              geological expedition in China, where she served as translator.
              She was miserable and immersed herself into writing lyrics as a
              way of coping.

              She put out her own self-titled album Laura Veirs, recorded live
              and featuring just her and guitar, in 1999. She has since made
              five highly acclaimed records with producer Tucker Martine. 2003
              saw the release of
              <span class="bold">Troubled by the Fire</span>, a full-band effort
              that found the artist sharing the studio with such luminaries as
              Bill Frisell and violist Eyvind Kang.
